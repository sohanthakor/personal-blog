Welcome to my personal blog! I built this platform using React.js to share what I learn as an engineering student.

The purpose of this blog is simple: to make technology easier to understand and to document my journey as I build projects, learn new frameworks, and solve real-world problems.

ðŸš€ Technologies used:
- React.js for frontend
- React Router for navigation
- MySQL for future blog storage
- GitHub for version control

ðŸ§  What you'll find here:
- Project write-ups
- Tips on IoT, Web Dev, Security
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Notes from my engineering courses

This project has helped me learn how to build and deploy a real-world web app from scratch. Thanks for reading!

The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing how we interact with the physical world.

ðŸŒ¿ Applications of IoT:
- Smart Agriculture: Monitor soil, temperature, humidity
- Smart Homes: Control lights, fans, doors remotely
- Health: Wearable fitness trackers and remote patient monitoring

ðŸ›  My IoT Project:
I built a weather monitoring system using:
- NodeMCU
- DHT11 temperature sensor
- Thingspeak for data visualization

The system sends live weather data to the cloud and displays it on a dashboard. It helped me understand how hardware and software interact in a real-world use case.

In future blogs, I'll show step-by-step how to build your own IoT projects!
